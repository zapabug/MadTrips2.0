# ðŸŒ´ MadTrips  Madeira ðŸŒ´

Hey there! Welcome to MadTrips, your cool little portal to discover awesome travel packages and happenings on the beautiful island of Madeira.

## What's this all about?

Think of MadTrips as a specialized browser, but instead of random internet stuff, it's all about finding cool things to do and see in Madeira. We're building this with a sprinkle of Nostr magic âœ¨, which means we plan to use Nostr for things like images, comments on trips/events, and eventually a curated feed of Madeira-specific goodies.

Right now, it's a Vite + React app, and we're aiming for a simple, straightforward way to browse what Madeira has to offer.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React with Vite (TypeScript)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Nostr Integration:** `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk` and `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-hooks`

## Getting Started

Want to peek under the hood or run it locally?

1.  **Clone the repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd MadTrips2.0
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    We use `pnpm` around here:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the dev server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
    This should get it running on `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

## What's Next?

We're in the early stages, focusing on getting the core browsing experience smooth.

One cool idea we're exploring for the future is a "**Claim Your Business**" feature. This means local businesses in Madeira could eventually use their Nostr accounts to manage their listings directly on MadTrips â€“ updating offers, availability, and all that jazz. Stay tuned!

Happy travels (or coding)!
