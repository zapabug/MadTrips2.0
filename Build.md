## LLD 1: 2025-05-12 00:00 UTC ‚Äî MadTrips (Simplified)

Project Name & Goal:
MadTrips ‚Äî A Vite + React application serving as a **browser for travel packages and events in Madeira.** It will feature a Madeira-tailored content feed, leveraging Nostr for displaying images and handling comment sections for trips and events. The primary focus is on providing a simple, user-friendly interface for discovering Madeira through Nostr.

Theme:
Simplicity, travel discovery, and Nostr-powered content for Madeira.

Core User Flow:
1. User opens the app.
2. User browses a feed of Madeira-related content (packages, events, articles).
3. User can view details of a package/event, including images (from Nostr) and descriptions.
4. User can read comments (from Nostr) associated with an item.
5. User can log in via Nostr (NIP-07) to post comments.

Key Features:
- Browse Madeira-specific travel packages and events.
- View package/event details with images sourced from Nostr.
- Read and write comments on packages/events via Nostr.
- Madeira-tailored content feed.
- User authentication via NIP-07 for interaction (commenting).

Out of Scope (for this simplified version):
- Complex backend trip booking/coordination by a "Fixer".
- Payment processing or deposit systems.
- Advanced admin dashboards beyond basic content curation (if any).
- Custom `CacheService` and `RelayService` (rely on NDK and `ndk-hooks`).

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Vite (React/TypeScript)
- Nostr Integration: @nostr-dev-kit/ndk, @nostr-dev-kit/ndk-hooks
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

## LLD 2: 2025-05-11 19:30 UTC ‚Äî Initial Project Setup & Code Migration

Project Initialization:
- Vite project created with React and TypeScript template.
- Switched to `pnpm` as the package manager.
- `package.json` name updated to `madtrips`.

Core Dependencies Installed:
- `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk`
- `@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-hooks`
- `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`, `tailwindcss-animate`
- `react-router-dom`

Styling Setup:
- Tailwind CSS configured (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.cjs`).
- Tailwind directives added to `src/index.css`.
- Brand colors integrated into Tailwind config.

Project Structure Created in `src/`:
- `components/` (with `home/`, `packages/`, `ui/`, `layout/` subdirectories)
- `hooks/` (Note: `useCache.ts` is now likely to be removed or heavily refactored)
- `contexts/` (`NostrContext.tsx` to be simplified)
- `data/`
- `constants/`

Code Migration from Previous Project (via `docs/` staging):
- React Components: `CallToAction`, `FeaturedPackages`, `FloatingLoginButton`, `FunchalMap`, `Hero`, `Navigation` migrated.
- Custom Hooks: `useCache.ts` (pending removal/refactor).
- Contexts: `NostrContext.tsx` (pending simplification).
- Data: `packages.ts`.
- Constants: `nostr.ts`, `relays.ts`.

Next Steps (Revised for Simplification):
- **Simplify `NostrContext.tsx`**: Remove `CacheService`, `RelayService` dependencies. Rely on NDK/ndk-hooks for core Nostr functionality.
- **Resolve Linter/Vite Errors**: Focus on errors related to the simplified scope.
- **Implement Core UI**: Build out the package/event browser, comment sections, and Madeira feed using the migrated components and new simplified Nostr logic.
- **Ensure NDK Initialization**: Set up NDK singleton and `useNDKInit` correctly, likely in `main.tsx` or `App.tsx`.

## LLD 3: 2025-05-12 (approx) ‚Äî Routing, Map Variants, Page Structure, Footer

Key Updates:
- **Routing Setup**: 
  - `react-router-dom` installed and configured in `src/App.tsx`.
  - Redundant `<BrowserRouter>` removed from `src/main.tsx` to fix nesting errors.
  - Routes established for `/`, `/map`, `/community`, `/packages`, `/packages/custom`, and `/packages/:id`.
- **Page Components Created (in `src/pages/`)**:
  - `MapPage.tsx`: Renders the full map component.
  - `CommunityPage.tsx`: Placeholder created.
  - `PackagesPage.tsx`: Placeholder created, then populated by porting `docs/packages/pacages.page.tsx`.
  - `CustomPackagePage.tsx`: Placeholder created, references `CustomPackageBuilder` component.
  - `PackageDetailPage.tsx`: Placeholder created, then populated with a simplified port of `docs/packages/id.page.tsx` (cart/checkout/Nostr logic stubbed).
- **Map Component (`FunchalMap.tsx`) Enhancements**:
  - Populated with `FEATURED_BUSINESSES` data from `src/data/packages.ts` (sourced from `madbiz.md`).
  - Added `variant` prop (`home` | `page`).
  - `variant="home"` (used in `App.tsx`) shows a smaller map-only view.
  - `variant="page"` (default, used in `MapPage.tsx`) shows the larger map and the featured business list.
- **Layout Components (`src/components/layout/`)**:
  - `Navigation.tsx`: Confirmed existing links align with new routes.
  - `Footer.tsx`: Created, initially basic, then replaced with a more detailed version adapted from `docs/contexts/ClientLayout.tsx` (social links, powered by, policy links; cache easter egg and Next.js specifics removed). Added to `App.tsx` layout.
- **Package Components (`src/components/packages/`)**:
  - `CustomPackageBuilder.tsx`: Placeholder created.

Next Steps:
- Port the `CustomPackageBuilder` component from the Next.js project.
- Implement Cart/Checkout functionality (porting/creating store, wrapper, page).
- Integrate Nostr context/authentication as needed.

# Build Documentation (Latest)

## Curation Workflow
- **Primary curation** is performed in `public/pacages/madbiz.md` (markdown, human-readable, with sections and comments).
- **Featured section** at the top highlights top picks for easy reference and UI integration.
- **Deprecated or unwanted entries** (e.g., Sweet Merenda, Sunshine Pub & Grill) are removed from the markdown and not included in the JSON.
- **Sync to JSON:**
  - After curation, the markdown is used as the source of truth to update `public/pacages/madeira_btc_businesses_20250511_172142.json`.
  - A script (`remove_tags.js`) is used to remove all `tags` and `bitcoin_payment` fields from the JSON for a clean dataset.
- **App/service integration** uses only the cleaned JSON; direct edits to the JSON are discouraged.

## Notes
- All business type clarifications and new entries should be made in the markdown first.
- The Featured section is intended for admin tools and UI highlights.
- Continue to maintain markdown as the master file for all curation and planning.

## LLD 4: 2025-05-12 (approx) ‚Äî Footer, Responsive Packages, Background Fix

Key Updates:
- **Footer Enhancements & Styling**:
  - Background color changed to teal (`#14857c`).
  - Added Nostr profile link (`njump.me` desktop / `nostr:` mobile).
  - Corrected assets folder name (`asssets` -> `assets`) and verified icon display (`/assets/nostr-icon...`, `/assets/bitcoin.png`).
- **Responsive Homepage Packages**:
  - Created `src/hooks/useResponsiveNumItems.ts` to determine item count based on screen size (1 mobile / 2 tablet / 3 desktop).
  - Created `src/components/PackageCard.tsx` for displaying individual packages.
  - Created `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` using the hook and card to show featured packages responsively.
- **Packages Page Implementation**:
  - Ported `CustomPackageBuilder` from `docs/` reference to `src/components/CustomPackageBuilder.tsx`, adapting for Vite/React and fixing type errors.
  - Created `src/pages/PackagesPage.tsx` to display all featured packages (using `PackageCard`) and the `CustomPackageBuilder`.
- **Error Resolution**:
  - Fixed Vite module loading errors related to default vs named exports (`PackagesPage` in `App.tsx`).
- **Layout Background Fix**:
  - Corrected visual layout issue where a gradient background appeared below the content.
  - Moved the `bg-gradient-to-b from-ocean to-forest` classes from the main wrapper `div` in `src/App.tsx` to the `<main>` element, scoping the gradient correctly to the content area.

Next Steps:
- Replace mock package data in `HomePage.tsx` and `PackagesPage.tsx` with actual data fetching/management.
- Implement Cart/Checkout/Booking functionality if required.
- Integrate Nostr context/authentication for commenting and interaction.

## LLD 5: Current Date (Reflects recent UI/UX changes and component restructuring)

Key Updates:
- **Custom Package Builder & Page Separation**:
  - `CustomPackageBuilder` component (`src/components/packages/CustomPackageBuilder.tsx`) implemented with interactive UI for duration, accommodation, and activity selection, including dynamic price calculation.
  - Dedicated page `src/pages/CustomPackagePage.tsx` created for the builder, separating it from the main packages listing.
  - Styling for the `CustomPackageBuilder` and `CustomPackagePage` introduction refined to a "sunset vacation" theme (warm backgrounds, bitcoin orange titles, amber text) to evoke an inviting feel, designed to sit on the existing `ocean-to-forest` page gradient.

- **`PackagesPage.tsx` Restructuring**:
  - Added a main page title: "Discover Madeira's Packages & Places".
  - Removed the integrated `CustomPackageBuilder`.
  - Created `src/components/BusinessCard.tsx` for a horizontal display of business details (name, type, city).
  - Created `src/components/KidFriendlyCard.tsx` for a simpler, grid-friendly display (name, type).
  - Repurposed space to feature new sections:
    - "Bitcoin Essentials & Family Fun": Uses `KidFriendlyCard` in a grid, incorporating kid-friendly places and Bitcoin ATM/P2P services (data manually curated from `madbiz.md`).
    - "Honorable Mentions": Updated with a subtitle ("Always ask: 'Can I pay in Bitcoin?'") and descriptive text. Placeholder for future business listings.

- **`madbiz.md` (Business Listings Curation)**:
  - Added a new section: `### üßë‚Äçüíª Coworking & Work Caf√©s`.
  - Added "Cowork Funchal" (Type: Coworking Space / Offices / Events) to this new section.
  - Moved "Loft - Brunch & Cocktails (multi-location)" (Type updated to: Brunch Bar / Laptop-friendly Coffee Spot) to this new section.
  - Ensured "COIN4CASH" is correctly listed under `### ‚Çø Bitcoin ATMs & P2P`.
  - Note: "Madeira Island Tours" was discussed and temporarily added, but user's subsequent file changes indicate it was removed.

- **Brand Colors & Tailwind**: 
  - New "Accent Blues & Purples" color palette added to `docs/brandColors.md`.
  - Guidance provided for integrating these into `tailwind.config.js`.

- **Code Maintenance**: 
  - Resolved linter errors in `PackagesPage.tsx` related to unused imports/variables.

Next Steps:
- Populate "Honorable Mentions" section with data in `PackagesPage.tsx`.
- Consider dynamic data fetching for business listings in `PackagesPage.tsx` from `madbiz.md` (or its JSON counterpart) instead of manual arrays.
- Continue with Nostr integration for comments and business "claiming" features as per LLD 5 in `Planning.md`.
